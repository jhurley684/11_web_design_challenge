# web_design_challenge

This project was to create a basic web site showing some weather plots depicting the relationship between latitudes and temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity.  It can be found at https://jhurley684.github.io/lattitude_travel.github.io/data.html  . The site, per requirements, consists of seven pages: A landing page (index.html), one comparing all four plots (comparison.html), one featuring a table with all related weather data (data.html), and four pages featuring a main plot and analysis discussion of that main plot as well as clickable thumbnails of all the plots on a side bar.  
While I completed all the requirements, I made a couple tweaks: Instead of branding as "Latitude" I made the brand "Latitude Travel" and pretended it was a travel site that was discussion using latitude as a consideration for making travel decisions.  Also, since my landing page turned out to be pretty much like the description for the comparison page I made the comparision page four large plots with a brief discussion about conclusions one could make when considering them all.
Per requirements:  All pages and navigation were responsive, the thumbnails were all clickable, the data table was responsive and utilized a bootstrape grid.  Since I used python to convert the .cvs table to .html I included my jupyter notebook file.
Enjoy clicking around.
